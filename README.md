My Open API Project

<!-- This open API project takes a few points of input from the user and returns a value based on that input. The points of input are as follows: location, date and time. These 3 choices from the user determine the weather data pulled from the open-meteo API. The final result is the temperature for that location, time and day. There are two locations to choose from, my current hometown and a previous place I lived and very much loved. The parameters of the date/time input are described on the webpage; there is a 6 day span of weather information in the JSON from the API. It includes two days before the present day, the present day, and the three days ahead. Selecting from beyond this timeframe will not produce the expected result. Although the API JSON data is in 15 minute increments, it will default to the nearest time in the JSON regardless of whether the input is in 15 minute increments. So, the time input is completely customizable. The results appear in their designated section after you press the "Check Temperature" button. There is an additional feature, where the user can take the resulting temperature, which is logged in Celsius, and convert it to Fahrenheit. I preferred this to converting the entire result to Fahrenheit, because then the user has a choice of which measurement they would like to see. -->
